        <p2>From a young age I was pushing boundaries in computing. Rather then play a game normally, I would try to change in-game values
        <br>for instance to gain extra health or money. I used a program called cheat engine and I felt that I was
        <br>an elite hacker. But it was only in offline, low budget games. 
        <br>This is because more established titles would have anti-cheat software - good times!

        <p2>When I got older and started to earn my own money, I thought building a PC would be a good idea.
        <br>I have never looked back on my choice. It took a long time to save AND decide which parts to go for.
        <br>Here are the components, cost and specs:

    <div style="text-align: center;">
        <p2>Being part of the underground music scene, I developed a passion for mixing Drum and Bass music.
        <br>originally, I started out using vinyl turntables at 16 years old. Times changed, and technology advanced.
        <br>I started buying digital music files (WAVS) as opposed to wax vinyl.
        <br>This was because I invested in a MIDI Controller. Its essentially turntables but powered through a PC.
        <br>you can't use vinyl on a controller as it reads music files through the PC/USB. It's a digital signal, not an analogue signal.
